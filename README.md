# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript ðŸš€
- A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript,
- designed to help improve problem-solving skills and coding efficiency.
- This repository serves as a reference for technical interviews, competitive programming, and coding challenges.

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside? 
- âœ… Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, etc.)
- âœ… Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- âœ… Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, BFS, DFS, etc.)
- âœ… Recursion & Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.)
- âœ… Greedy Algorithms & Backtracking (Subset Sum, N-Queens, etc.)
- âœ… Graph Algorithms (Dijkstraâ€™s, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskalâ€™s, etc.)

ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (for running algorithms in a local environment)
